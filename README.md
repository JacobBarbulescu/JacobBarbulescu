**`Aspiring game developer`**

I am a current full-time Computer Science undergrad at Stevens Institute of Technology looking to break into the game development industry. I mostly make my games in Unity and pride myself in making the entire game from scratch. All code, art, and even music is made by me for all of my projects so that I can practice and learn every aspect of making a game. One of the biggest lessons that I carry with me is the importance of easy modification. I almost never add a feature without developing a system to modularly handle that feature. Not only does it save me many headaches while developing, it also teaches me a lot about abstraction and blackboxing. Why manually add in a new powerup when a powerup manager can do it all for you with the click of a button?

The most fascinating part of making games for me is building the tools to make them. I love organizing my games into highly modular, flexible programs that I can then use to rapidly add/remove mechanics and features. It feels like building a clock with all of its small pieces combining into a beautiful mechanism, and I often catch myself being more excited at making the systems to design my games with than designing the games themselves! My heart is set on working on game engines and tools to let game designers create the greatest, most imaginative games possible.
